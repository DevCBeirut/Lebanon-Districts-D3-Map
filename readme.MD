I got the Shapefiles for lebanon here

Map of Lebanon, its governorates and districts. I made it with D3.js and a TopoJSON file converted from a Shapefile downloaded at <a href="http://www.gadm.org/">http://www.gadm.org.</a> I would like to give credit to <a href="https://github.com/CodeWritingCow">CodeWritingCow</a> for his repository <a href="https://github.com/CodeWritingCow/d3-js-maps-syria-districts">D3.js map of Syria
